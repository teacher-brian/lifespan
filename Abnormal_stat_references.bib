  abstract = {Data science is an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines elements of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and knowledge in a particular application domain for the purpose of extracting meaningful information from the increasingly sophisticated array of data available in many settings. These data tend to be nontraditional, in the sense that they are often live, large, complex, and/or messy. A first course in statistics at the undergraduate level typically introduces students to a variety of techniques to analyze small, neat, and clean datasets. However, whether they pursue more formal training in statistics or not, many of these students will end up working with data that are considerably more complex, and will need facility with statistical computing techniques. More importantly, these students require a framework for thinking structurally about data. We describe an undergraduate course in a liberal arts environment that provides students with the tools necessary to apply data science. The course emphasizes modern, practical, and useful skills that cover the full data analysis spectrum, from asking an interesting question to acquiring, managing, manipulating, processing, querying, analyzing, and visualizing data, as well communicating findings in written, graphical, and oral forms.

  abstract = {Statistics departments are facing rapid growth in enrollments and increases in demand for courses. This article discusses the use of design and analysis of experiments (DAE) as a nonterminal second course in statistics for undergraduate statistics majors, minors, and other students seeking exposure to the practice of statistics beyond the introductory course. DAE is a gateway to approaching statistical thinking as data-based problem solving by exposing students to statistical, computational, data, and communication skills in the second course. Given the somewhat antiquated view of design and deemphasis of classical design of experiments topics in the new ASA curriculum guidelines, DAE may seem an odd choice for the second course; however, it exposes students to the breadth of the statistical problem-solving process, explores foundational issues of the discipline, and is accessible to students who have not yet finished their advanced mathematical training. These skills remain essential in the data science era as students must be equipped to understand the potential and peril of found data using the principles of design. While DAE may not be the appropriate second course for all statistics programs, it provides a strong foundation for causal inference and experimental design for students pursuing a B.S. in Statistics in a program housed in a department of statistics.[Received December 2014.

This will enable programs to determine whether students are learning what we want them to learn and to work on continuously improving the program over time. The first step is to translate the broader Guidelines into institution-specific measurable learning outcomes. This article focuses on providing examples of learning outcomes developed by different institutions based on the 2000 Guidelines. The companion article by Moore and Kaplan (this issue) focuses on choosing appropriate assessment methods and rubrics and creating an assessment plan.

Within this past year, the ASA has issued a new and comprehensive set of guidelines for undergraduate programs (ASA, Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Statistical Science). Accepting (and applauding) all this as background, the current article argues the need to rethink our curriculum from the ground up, and offers five principles and two caveats intended to help us along the path toward a new synthesis. These principles and caveats rest on my sense of three parallel evolutions: the convergence of trends in the roles of mathematics, computation, and context within statistics education. These ongoing changes, together with the articles cited above and the seminal provocation by Leo Breiman call for a deep rethinking of what we teach to undergraduates. In particular, following Brown and Kass, we should put priority on two goals, to make ?fundamental concepts accessible? and to ?minimize prerequisites to research.?[Received December 2014.

However, 10~years after the release of the Guidelines for the Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) College Report, 2005, and the subsequent movement to stress conceptual understanding and foster active learning in statistics classrooms, the sequence still remains a traditional, lecture-intensive course. In this article, we discuss various instructional approaches, activities, and assessments that can be used to foster active learning and emphasize conceptual understanding while still covering the necessary theoretical content students need to be successful in subsequent statistics or actuarial science courses. In addition, we share student reflections on these course enhancements. The course revision we suggest doesn?t require substantial changes in content, so other mathematical statistics instructors can implement these strategies without sacrificing concepts in probability and inference that are fundamental to the needs of their students.

This impact comes from simulation-based methods (a) clearly presenting the overarching logic of inference, (b) strengthening ties between statistics and probability/mathematical concepts, (c) encouraging a focus on the entire research process, (d) facilitating student thinking about advanced statistical concepts, (e) allowing more time to explore, do, and talk about real research and messy data, and (f) acting as a firm-er foundation on which to build statistical intuition. Thus, we argue that simulation-based inference should be an entry point to an undergraduate statistics program for all students, and that simulation-based inference should be used throughout all under-graduate statistics courses. To achieve this goal and fully recognize the benefits of simulation-based inference on the undergraduate statistics program, we will need to break free of historical forces tying undergraduate statistics curricula to mathematics, consider radical and innovative new pedagogical approaches in our courses, fully implement assessment-driven content innovations, and embrace computation throughout the curriculum.[Received December 2014.
