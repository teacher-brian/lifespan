# Week 6 Feb 6 {#week6}

## Orientation

I've been re-reading the lifespan textbook and I am wondering if there some ways to think about how text books organized information the net as possible that they are credibly oversimplifications.  

Here are some examples:

<p style = 'text-decoration: underline'>Claim:</p>

  >In addition to dopamine, the adolescent brain is affected by oxytocin which facilitates bonding and makes social connections more rewarding.

No reference though.  Possibly connects to Dobbs listed just above.  My quick check on that resource goes to a national geographic article.  That's weird.  And my knowledge of these sorts of claims comes from my experience that most of those research claims are hypothetical, or based on other mammals.  

I worry that this bit about oxytocin is overgeneralized (cf [replication crisis](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/2/13/18221876/oxytocin-morality-valentines){target='_blank'})

As you read the textbook, keep track of its claims that either don't have references, or give you the vibes that there is an oversimplification.


#### Chapter 6 Learning Objectives

 * Some learning objectives for the textbook (not necessarily the course) can be found here [Lally and Valentine-French Lifespan textbook learning objectives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gd39NAUlu-xPQp_JzwjIHGXgthGX5cUIbJ2gjkIOG-4/edit?usp=sharing){target='_blank'}

 * [Textbook Vocabulary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Uv56eqUwrmIkzcJWUVr1cJEKWFWxEQrSCMgfJ8NYAA/edit?usp=sharing){target='_blank'}

 
## Read some stuff

1. [Read Chapter 6, Adolescence](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Development/Book%3A_Lifespan_Development_-_A_Psychological_Perspective_(Lally_and_Valentine-French)/06%3A_Adolescence){target='_blank'}

   * While reading, take some notes regarding textbook claims that might sounds too simple.  Keep track of their locations.

2. Read your chosen article from handbook volume.  Okay..skim it, but find some sections that you find interesting. 


## Do some stuff

A. Write a summary..yes, a summary of what you read from your chosen chapter/section from the Developmental Handbook [@lernerHandbookChildPsychology2015] that you asked for in week 5.  The goal is to write for your understanding, which means you may want to write a bit about questions you have, connections to your work/childhood/relevant stuff to you. 

B. I want you to have questions about this article you read.  So, please list at least 3.

C. How, go to chat gpt: https://chat.openai.com/

  * You will need to register an account with them.
  * Think of gpt as a person to converse with.  Be skeptical of it, so if it says something as if it were all knowing, don't believe it.  I am still working on the right metaphor here.  Like, what if you had access to a professor in a discipline and could ask them anything?  And that you could treat them as someone who actually doesn't know more than you, is biased, narrow minded, that you are essentially above them in status and so if they say something, you don't reflexively think they are right and are also not afraid of calling out their B.S. 

  * Give chat gpt an introduction to your question.  You are framing the conversation here. 
  * ask your question
  * when it answers, use the critical thinking standards to think about its answer.  Is there an area that is weak?  Ask GPT to explain, to reconcile itself, to consider things it left out.  
  * Highlight and copy the chat gpt thread and paste it into your google doc.  You might need to edit the formatting a bit.  

D. Share your notes/questions in from #1 above regarding textbook claims that are either missing references, or that you feel skeptical in its presentation.  If you have done some extra research on these topics, include that as well; I think future weeks we may come back to this. 

E. You might want to use chat gpt to justify/critically analyize the textbook. 

F. Share your work in the #week 6 channel

# Week 7 Adolescence redux Feb 13 {#week7}

Last week was a mix of self-reflection assignments and article summary.  But we didn't get into much of the adolescent part of development, and really, it's an important period of time for humans.

Consider some of these concepts:  

- Risks

- Fables

- Formal Reasoning

- Identity Formation

These are some big ideas and issues. 

## Read some stuff

1. Without putting too much research into it, what are some examples of risky behavior that come to mind? What makes them risky? Consider the ideas of control, power, parental fears, etc. Write down your ideas in your one google doc.

2. [Revisit Chapter 6, Adolescence, as needed](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Development/Book%3A_Lifespan_Development_-_A_Psychological_Perspective_(Lally_and_Valentine-French)/06%3A_Adolescence){target='_blank'}

3. Read/skim [Chapter 21 from Volume 3, The development of sexuality](https://lifespanwinter23.slack.com/archives/C04H76DCYQJ/p1676339992920239){target='_blank'} @lernerHandbookChildPsychology2015


## Do some stuff

A. [Case 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x8KwE-_ZGMRZcqE1U5L0r8KeXZdBrlHvogAM_mT1Aq4/edit){target='_blank'}

B. Write a bit about risks now that you've done some reading about it.  Some questions to consider:

  * what makes something risky?  Who owns the term? 
  * what are areas of disagreement between parents and adolescents about risky behavior, and what can be done to bring them together..to see eye to eye so to speak? 
  * Put your thoughts, questions, answers into your google document

C. Ask Chat gpt what it thinks are cliche's about adolescence.  Ask it about cultural differences.  Ask it meta questions.  In other words, don't think of chat gpt as a source of content or correct, objective, knowledge.  Think of it instead as someone who does not think critically but has access to a lot of information and can emotionally handle tough questions (because, of course, it's not human.)

D. Post your work to the week 7 slack channel

# Week 8 Emerging adulthood Feb 20 {#week8}

The rest of the quarter is really about the process of getting older and becoming more mature as an adult. But these are terms that are massively influenced by culture and zeitgeist. Nonetheless, all cultures recognize that there is some process where a child turns into an adult and historically (like before 100 years ago) adolescence was that time. But, things have changed and [some even argue that adolescence has been drawn out to the mid 20's](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42732442){target="_blank"}.  

But now that you're out of adolescence, what now?

### Chapter 7 Learning Objectives

 * Some learning objectives for the textbook (not necessarily the course) can be found here [Lally and Valentine-French Lifespan textbook learning objectives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gd39NAUlu-xPQp_JzwjIHGXgthGX5cUIbJ2gjkIOG-4/edit?usp=sharing){target='_blank'}

 * [Textbook Vocabulary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Uv56eqUwrmIkzcJWUVr1cJEKWFWxEQrSCMgfJ8NYAA/edit?usp=sharing){target='_blank'}

## Read/watch some stuff

1. [Read Chapter 7, Emerging adulthood](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Development/Book%3A_Lifespan_Development_-_A_Psychological_Perspective_(Lally_and_Valentine-French)/07%3A_Emerging_and_Early_Adulthood){target='_blank'}

2. Watch a 5 min youtube [video by Barton Paulson on Emergent adulthood](https://youtu.be/ox6JN24oIbI){target='_blank'}  

3. Watch a longer [video by Paulson on Early adulthood](https://youtu.be/p7StHobYid4){target='_blank'}  
   * I found his comments on extrinsic versus intrinsic motivation a bit light. I wonder about the boredom he mentions later on and the relationship between extrinsic motivation and boredom.


## Do stuff

  
1. [Complete a metacognitive assignment.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vKwiB31xhBR9Al1guiTw2odyVcCiIWcrqslSz1cKkqk/edit?usp=sharing){target='_blank'} 
    * This may take some time. 
    * Post your work in the [#week 8](https://lifespanwinter23.slack.com/archives/C04MUQ0PD62){target='_blank'} channel. 

2. What are some cliche's of young adulthood? How accurate are they?  For instance, is  "birds of a feather flock together" or "opposites attract?" more accurate?   I've got old cliche's...but what is the new wisdom?

3. To what degree does this apparent contradiction  "career focus vs changing the world" represent some aspect of William Perry's development of thought? 

4. With an assumption that many of my students are in this domain of emerging adulthood, what aspects do you think are missing from the text?

5. Post your musings to [#week 8](https://lifespanwinter23.slack.com/archives/C04MUQ0PD62){target='_blank'} 

# Week 9 Middle adulthood Feb 27 {#week9}

Now we see that people are faced with life challenges that comes with middle age.  Physical declines, life satisfaction, family and work responsibilities, all with existential issues in the backdrop

## Read some stuff

1. [Chapter 8, Middle Adulthood](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Development/Book%3A_Lifespan_Development_-_A_Psychological_Perspective_(Lally_and_Valentine-French)/08%3A_Middle_Adulthood){target='_blank'}

2. watch about a 12 min [video by Paulson on middle adulthood](https://youtu.be/8sIStz0WwJU){target='_blank'}   




## Do some stuff

1. [take the big 5 test here](http://www.personalitytest.net/ipip/index.html){target='_blank'}
    * If you have taken my intro class recently, you've probably taken this test and now would be an interesting time to retake it and see whether your scores have changed.  This would be a simple reliability test of the big 5, for you.
    * There are 2 versions to choose from, a short and long.
    * You may want to save your output for posterity.  The output should include your score on the 5 dimensions (OCEAN) plus 6 sub-tests for a total of 30 results.
    ```{block,type='instructorNote'}
    Don't publish this in your one-doc to rule...You can if you want but it is somewhat private information. 
    ```

2. Case Study 4.  This will be sent out in slack via direct message. When you are ready, send me a direct message.   When you have finished the case, share this work in the #[Week-9](https://lifespanwinter23.slack.com/archives/C04R57CDAKF){target='_blank'}

3.  Using the critical thinking standards try to find and evaluate some sources on the Intelligence quotient (IQ) and other measures of intellectual abilities. Write your ideas into your one google doc, and then share them [#intelligence-IQ channel](https://lifespanwinter23.slack.com/archives/C04R85HDDMG){target='_blank'}. Debate is welcome on this one.  Yes, you'll be posting the same google doc in 2 channels. 


# Week 10 Late Adulthood March 6 {#week10}

Late adulthood has physical and mental decline, potential for depression and suicide, but also the depth of what is meaningful.

## Read some stuff

1. [Chapter 9, Late Adulthood](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Development/Book%3A_Lifespan_Development_-_A_Psychological_Perspective_(Lally_and_Valentine-French)/09%3A_Late_Adulthood){target='_blank'}

2. Watch [Grief walker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WIcstsbsxrYcQS5wRttmVm8RK66mNISvp4brwkr-gy0/edit?usp=sharing){target='_blank'}. The link takes you to a google doc of instructions, along with links to the video.  This is a kind of case study, but more suggestive.  It's not a perfect film, certainly. And the protagonist is not a perfect person. I say more in the prompt.

3. Watch about a 16 min [video by Paulson on late adulthood](https://youtu.be/8sIStz0WwJU){target='_blank'}   

## Do some stuff

3. Post your work on the case study and the cultural practices into [#week 11](https://lifespanwinter23.slack.com/archives/C04R57F4693){target="_blank"}

4. [Final Self-reflection](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaK9D2O4yXPc5Mk0MhJ6naQ9qw3g53x8GsruZsIl5CM-4Gjg/viewform){target="_blank"}


```{block, type='instructorNote'}
Deadline for the quarter is March 19th, late evening.  
```





```{block,type='instructorNote'}
some thoughts for future classes
* SIDS
* fevers
* Spanking
* language
* impulse control
```

My intention is to expose you to a few things here they are:

An introductory lecture to lifespan or developmental psychology in particular

An opportunity to peruse vocabulary from the first three chapters

The chance to think a little bit about metacognition across the lifespan 

```{block,type='instructorNote',include=F}
My own personal questions about content has a bit to do with the intersection of the history of what I was taught about the scientific method and the different theories about people about science about psychology, about children and how that knowledge intersects with a particular historical blindness to non-western views.

For instance we're often taught about how the Greeks were the beginning of human rationality, but in a lot of ways they with the Romans we're actually taking advantage of intelligent people in Mesopotamia and Alexandria oh, the video is interesting when the professor goes into detail about the history of the views of children, all of those views seemed to be centered on a relatively Europeans interview. I'm curious about how countries outside of Europe and United States view children 400 years ago a thousand years ago

I don't know if I have the time to find research on that .
