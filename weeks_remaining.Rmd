# Week 10 Late Adulthood March 6 {#week10}

Late adulthood has physical and mental decline, potential for depression and suicide, but also the depth of what is meaningful.

## Read some stuff

1. [Chapter 9, Late Adulthood](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Development/Book%3A_Lifespan_Development_-_A_Psychological_Perspective_(Lally_and_Valentine-French)/09%3A_Late_Adulthood){target='_blank'}

2. Watch [Grief walker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WIcstsbsxrYcQS5wRttmVm8RK66mNISvp4brwkr-gy0/edit?usp=sharing){target='_blank'} This is a kind of case study, but more suggestive.  It's not a perfect film, certainly. And the protagonist is not a perfect person.

3. Watch about a 16 min [video by Paulson on late adulthood](https://youtu.be/8sIStz0WwJU){target='_blank'}

```{block,type='instructorNote'}
some thoughts for future classes
* SIDS
* fevers
* Spanking
* language
* impulse control
```

My intention is to expose you to a few things here they are:

An introductory lecture to lifespan or developmental psychology in particular

An opportunity to peruse vocabulary from the first three chapters

The chance to think a little bit about metacognition across the lifespan 

```{block,type='instructorNote',include=F}
My own personal questions about content has a bit to do with the intersection of the history of what I was taught about the scientific method and the different theories about people about science about psychology, about children and how that knowledge intersects with a particular historical blindness to non-western views.

For instance we're often taught about how the Greeks were the beginning of human rationality, but in a lot of ways they with the Romans we're actually taking advantage of intelligent people in Mesopotamia and Alexandria oh, the video is interesting when the professor goes into detail about the history of the views of children, all of those views seemed to be centered on a relatively Europeans interview. I'm curious about how countries outside of Europe and United States view children 400 years ago a thousand years ago

I don't know if I have the time to find research on that .
