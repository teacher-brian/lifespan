The original case study was set up with the man asking for a prenuptial agreement.

Several years ago I began giving different versions of the 4th case study.  I wondered whether students would treat the case differently if it was the woman requesting the prenuptial.

So, I started tracking the results.  



First here is how your class responded:

```{r,error=FALSE}
df<-read.csv("./teachstats/Final.txt",sep=",",row.names = NULL,na.strings="")
df<-data.frame(na.omit(df,row.names=NULL))
df$name<-factor(df$name)
#df$quarter<-factor(df$quarter)
df$prenup<-factor(df$prenup)
```
